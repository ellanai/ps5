## Step 1: Develop initial scraper and crawler

### 1. Scraping (PARTNER 1)

```{python}
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

  ```{python}
url = 'https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/'
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
# Test to make sure it looks right
soup.text[0:50]
  ```

```{python}
# Extract the title of the enforcement action
tag = soup.find_all('a')
titles = list(filter(lambda tag: tag.get('href') and '/fraud/enforcement/' in tag['href'], soup.find_all('a')))
# There were 3 items pulled in that I don't want, so I'm taking them out
titles = titles[3: ]

# Extract the date of the enforcement action
date_divs = soup.find_all('div', class_='font-body-sm margin-top-1')
dates = [div.find('span', class_='text-base-dark padding-right-105').text for div in date_divs if div.find('span', class_='text-base-dark padding-right-105')]

# Extract the category of the enforcement action
date_divs = soup.find_all('div', class_='font-body-sm margin-top-1')
categories = [div.find('li').text for div in date_divs if div.find('li')]

# Extract the link associated with the enforcement action
links = [tag['href'] for tag in titles]
# Add domain
links = ['https://oig.hhs.gov' + link for link in links]
print(links[0])
```

```{python}
# Make a data frame
enforcement_action_df = pd.DataFrame({
  "Title": titles,
  "Date": dates,
  "Category": categories,
  "Link": links
})
print(enforcement_action_df.head())
```

### 2. Crawling (PARTNER 1)

```{python}
url = "https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/macomb-county-doctor-and-pharmacist-agree-to-pay-700948-to-settle-false-claims-act-allegations/"
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

li_tags = soup.find_all('li')
for li in li_tags:
    if 'Agency:' in li.get_text():
        # Extract text after "Agency:"
        agency = li.get_text().split('Agency:')[-1].strip()  
        agencies.append(agency)
```



```{python}
# Create a for loop to extract agency from each link in list
agencies = []

for link in links:
    response = requests.get(link)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    li_tags = soup.find_all('li')
    for li in li_tags:
      if 'Agency:' in li.get_text():
          # Extract text after "Agency:"
          agency = li.get_text().split('Agency:')[-1].strip()  
          agencies.append(agency)

# Update data frame
enforcement_action_df["Agency"] = agencies
print(enforcement_action_df.head())
```

## Step 2: Making the scraper dynamic

### 1. Turning the scraper into a function 

* a. Pseudo-Code (PARTNER 2)

First, we define a function with parameters 'year' and 'month'. This will allow us to fetch enforcement actions from a specific date (starting year and month as inputs) onward.

Second, we constrain the starting year as >= 2013, since only enforcement actions after 2013 are listed. Otherwise, the function prints a message saying 'Please, enter a year >= 2013'

Third, we set up our general scrapping code by identifying: (i) base_url, (ii) lists to store my data (titles, dates, categories, links and agencies), (iii) only links in the first page, and (iv) an end_date to avoid unnecessary scraping past the current date.

As a fourth step, we create a loop that will allow us to go through all the pages. We use a while loop because it allows the scraper to keep fetching and processing pages until it reaches a specific condition, such as the end of the data or a date limit. A for loop, on the other hand, is not very useful in this case, because we don't have a specific range of observations.

As a fifth step, we start extracting data (all links and dates related to enforcement actions), filtering information only within our desired time range, and convert the extracted date in datetime format.

Just as a caveat, even when our general/initial loop was a While True, to extract the information within each webpage we replicate what we did in **Step 1**, and use a for loop. 

As a sixth step, given that we are crawling through multiple webpages, we increment the page number to move to the next page and add a 1-second delay to avoid overwhelming the server. Here we use the .sleep() function.

Finally, we create a dataframe with all the information retrieved and saved it as a csv file named as 'enforcement_actions_year_month.csv'

how many times I'm going through ny while loop

* b. Create Dynamic Scraper (PARTNER 2)

```{python}
def scrape_enforcement_actions(year, month):
    # Validate the start date
    if year < 2013:
        print("Please enter a start date year >= 2013")
        return
    
    # Initialize variables
    base_url = 'https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/'
    all_titles, all_dates, all_categories, all_links, all_agencies = [], [], [], [], []
    page_num = 1
    
    counter = 0
    
    while True:  # Loop through pages
        counter += 1
        print(counter)

        # Record start time for the page load
        page_start_time = time.time()

        url = f"{base_url}?page={page_num}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        
        # Extract titles, dates, and links on the page
        titles = list(filter(lambda tag: tag.get('href') and '/fraud/enforcement/' in tag['href'], soup.find_all('a')))[3:]
        date_divs = soup.find_all('div', class_='font-body-sm margin-top-1')

        # Check if the page has no new data
        if not titles:
            break
        
        # Define the start date for comparison
        start_date = datetime(year, month, 1)
        
        for i in range(len(titles)):
            title = titles[i].text.strip()
            date_text = date_divs[i].find('span', class_='text-base-dark padding-right-105').text.strip()
            category = date_divs[i].find('li').text.strip() if date_divs[i].find('li') else ""
            link = 'https://oig.hhs.gov' + titles[i]['href']
                        
            # Extract year and month only from the date
            action_date = datetime.strptime(date_text, "%B %d, %Y")
            action_year_month = action_date.replace(day=1)

            # Break the loop if action_date is earlier than the specified start date
            if action_year_month < start_date:
                break

            # Only add actions from the specified start year and month onward
            all_titles.append(title)
            all_dates.append(action_date)
            all_categories.append(category)
            all_links.append(link)

            # Fetch agency details for each enforcement action
            agency = "N/A"
            agency_response = requests.get(link)
            agency_soup = BeautifulSoup(agency_response.text, 'html.parser')
            
            # Find the agency within <li> tags that contain "Agency:"
            for li in agency_soup.find_all('li'):
                if 'Agency:' in li.get_text():
                    agency = li.get_text().split('Agency:')[-1].strip()
                    break  # Stop after finding the first match
            
            all_agencies.append(agency)

        # If the action_date on this page is earlier than start_date, stop scraping
        if action_year_month < start_date:
            break

        # Move to the next page
        page_num += 1
        time.sleep(1)

        # Record end time for the page load and calculate elapsed time
        page_end_time = time.time()
        page_load_time = page_end_time - page_start_time
        print(f"Time taken to change page {page_num}: {page_load_time:.2f} seconds")

    # Save to DataFrame with Date in datetime format
    enforcement_action_df = pd.DataFrame({
        "Title": all_titles,
        "Date": all_dates,
        "Category": all_categories,
        "Link": all_links,

    })

    # Save DataFrame to CSV
    file_name = f"enforcement_actions_{start_date.year}_{start_date.month}.csv"
    enforcement_action_df.to_csv(file_name, index=False)
    print(f"Data saved to {file_name}")
    
    return enforcement_action_df

    return enforcement_action_df

# Define the year and month for filtering
year = 2023
month = 1

# Record the start time
start_time = time.time()

# Run the dynamic scraper function for all pages

print(f"Scraping completed in {elapsed_time_m:.2f} minutes")
